## RDP seqmatch classification
# This is ONE WAY to assign taxononmic classification to OTUs. There are many other options for annotation
# You are assigning taxonomy to your OTU seed sequences - NOT all the sequences in that OTU cluster
# The seqmatch script will evaluate the first 20 hits only baed on the S_ab score (based on kmer coverage - see RDP site for details)
# Threshold for assignemnt is set at S_ab >= 0.6. If multiple reference seqs match at equal S_ab, the lowest common taxonomy will be reported

# This must be done online: http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/seqmatch/seqmatch_intro.jsp
# Change "Source:" to "Isolates"

# Download the output as text
# Either put this in your analysis directory, or make a new directory in analysis for "taxonomy"
seqmatch_download.txt

# You need to parse the seqmatch output to pick approximate taxonomies based on threshold cutoffs
# Set your BIN first:
BIN="/Groups/LRGC/miseq_bin/"

$BIN/parse_RDP.pl seqmatch_download.txt > parsed_RDP.txt

# Now add the parsed lineages to your OTU table
$BIN/RDP_lineage.pl parsed_RDP.txt td_OTU_tag_mapped.txt > td_OTU_tag_mapped_lineage.txt

#This OTU table will be your input for QIIME
