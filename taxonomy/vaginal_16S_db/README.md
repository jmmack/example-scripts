The vaginal 16s reference database comes from:

Srinivasan S, Hoffman NG, Morgan MT, Matsen FA, Fiedler TL, Ross FJ, McCoy CO, Hall RW, Bumgarner R, Marrazzo JM, et al. Bacterial communities in women with bacterial vaginosis: high resolution phylogenetic analyses reveal relationships of microbiota to clinical criteria. PLoS ONE. 2012;7:e37818

Reference Package S1

(vaginal-0.9.2-raxml.refpkg) Contains files required for classification of vaginal reference sequences in the V3/V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.


#### Processing

Gaps were removed from the sequence alignment file `vaginal.phylip-convex.fasta`, and taxonomic names were pulled from `chosen.csv-convex`

#### Output
A single gap-less multi-fasta of taxonomically named V3-V4 sequences
