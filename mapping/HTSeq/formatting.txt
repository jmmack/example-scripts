FORMATTING GFF FOR HTSEQ

- NO headers
- Contig ID (first column) must match to mapping file (SAM format)
- NO duplicated entries (with same start and end positions)
- Must have a unique gene identifier with some kind of tag in the annotation (last) column (e.g. mine has "gene_id=")
- Third column must have the type of feature you want to map and you must define it when running the script with -t (e.g. "-t gene")
