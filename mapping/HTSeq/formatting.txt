FORMATTING GFF FOR HTSEQ

- NO headers
- Contig ID (first column) must match to mapping file (SAM format)
- NO duplicated entries (with same start and end positions)
- Must have a unique gene identifier with some kind of tag in the annotation (last) column (e.g. mine has "gene_id=")
	- If you are not using the default (gene_id) you must define with -i
- Third column must have the feature type you want to map and you must define it (exact match to word) when running the script with -t (e.g. "-t gene")

htseq-count sample.sam sample_htseq.gff -t gene -i gene_id -a 0 > out_sample_q0.txt 2>&1&

-a qscore cutoff (default of 10)



#get the assignment information
	grep "__" out_sample_q0.txt >> q0_summary.txt

#get the counts tables per sample
	grep "^gene" out_$sample_q0.txt > sample_counts_q0.txt
