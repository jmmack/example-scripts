To start:
- View "JeansNotes.md" in the RLadies markdown workshop (cloned from https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_london_ontario/tree/master/2018-03-06_rmarkdown)

---

For R:
- See installation and compilation instructions (rmarkdown_install.R)

For GitHub:
- Make sure to use GitHub markdown style

- I like to use Atom to compose Markdown files as it has a Markdown preview pane (use ctrl+shift+m to toggle)
